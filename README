Docker setup
    Create image
        $ sudo docker build -t decisiontree . --rm

    Run image
        $ sudo docker run -d -p 3000:3000 decisiontree

To run performance test:
    $ stack exec -- performance-test +RTS -A200M -N2 -s

    The test assumed that there exists a dataset "datasets/titanic_train_pruned.json".

    While all sparks are converted it doesn't seem like they are run in parallel.
    It might be because of my weak, 2-core machine.
